Klein Box

The meshes in this archive describe a polyhedral version of the Klein bottle, constructed by Keenan Crane.  The archive also contains a printable pattern for constructing this polyhedron out of paper, cardboard, or other flat material.  Since the Klein bottle intersects itself, it is impossible to form the polyhedron from a single flat sheet.  Instead, the instructions suggest to build the "box" and "J" pieces separately, insert the J in the box, then fill in the region of intersection with a final square of material.
